# Retrieval-Augmented Generation Bot

This is a practice I did based on the following course: https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/preprocessing-unstructured-data-for-llm-applications

To get started, it's necessary to add a ```.env``` file containing the https://openai.com/ and https://unstructured.io/ API KEY
as follows:

```
UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY=xyz
OPEN_AI_KEY=xyz
```
